# Design-Patterns
This is my learning process of design pattern.


### 1 - Strategy Pattern definition
    #### The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms,encapsulates each one and make them interchangeable.Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### 2 - Factory Method Pattern definition
    #### The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object,but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

### 3 - Abstract Factory Pattern definition
    #### The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
